# CSPLIT.C
A simple terminal split timer written in C.

Motivation: I was going to do an exam practice and realized I didn't have a nice split timer, and writing one would probably be good practice.

## Building csplit
| compiler | command |
|----------|---------|
| clang    | clang csplit.c -o csplit |
| gcc      | gcc csplit.c -o csplit |

## Usage
| command | usage |
|---------|--------|
| csplit --help    | list keybinds and flags |
| q      | quit csplit |
| s      | new split |
